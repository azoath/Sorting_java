In data structures and algorithms (DSA), sorting refers to the process of arranging elements in a specific order, often ascending or descending. There are various sorting algorithms, each with its own advantages and performance characteristics. Here are some popular sorting algorithms:

 Bubble Sort: It compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process repeats until the entire array is sorted. It's simple but not efficient for large datasets.

 Selection Sort: This algorithm divides the array into two parts: sorted and unsorted. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first unsorted element.

 Insertion Sort: Similar to how people sort cards in hand, this algorithm builds the sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly picking up the next element and inserting it into its correct position in the already sorted part.

 Merge Sort: It's a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into smaller sub-arrays, sorts them, and then merges them back together. It's efficient and has a time complexity of O(n log n).

 Quick Sort: Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the array into smaller segments where elements less than the pivot are on one side and elements greater than the pivot are on the other. It then recursively sorts the sub-arrays.

 Heap Sort: It uses a binary heap data structure to sort elements. It first converts the array into a max-heap (or min-heap), then repeatedly extracts the maximum (or minimum) element and reconstructs the heap until the entire array is sorted.

 Counting Sort: This algorithm works best for integers within a specific range. It counts the occurrences of each element and uses this information to place the elements in sorted order.

 Radix Sort: Suitable for sorting numbers, it sorts digits individually from least significant to most significant or vice versa, often using another stable sort as a subroutine.
